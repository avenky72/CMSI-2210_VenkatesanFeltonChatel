SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

If you got a warning about using "gets()" when you compiled your
   "sayhelloplus.c" program, try using a different function.  Look up
   the "C" functions on the Internet and see if you can find something
   else to use, like "scanf()" or "fgets()" or something else.

As a challenge to yourselves, see if you can find a different way of reading
   values from the user.  There are several different ways of doing that, so
   do a little research to see what else is available.

For your formatting in "C", make your "int main...." start at the margin and
   then indent everything inside that block several spaces.  With only one
   space for the indent, it almost looks like everything is at the same
   indent level which can confuse the reader.

Off to a great start!
