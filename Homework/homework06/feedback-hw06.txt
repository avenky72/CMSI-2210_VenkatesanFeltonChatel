Total possible points 100

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 57.00/100.00 which is 57% which is not so great...

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm: doesn't assemble since you omitted the comma at the
   end of the 'num1' and 'num2' definitions.  I fixed that for you, but then
   there are two errors that the instruction is not supported in 64-bit mode.
   sorry.

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c: the command in your source file
   doesn't work.  I get a 'symbol not found' linker error for "_gcd".  You
   were supposed to create a separate file called "findGCDfunc.nasm" for this
   problem, which you didn't do.  oops.

problem 3 partiygen.nasm: lines 9 and 25 give the assembler error "instruction
   not supported in 64-bit mode".  The algorithm looks right.

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c: perfect.

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c: makeNBOC.c works as a standalone program
   but was supposed to be a function.  The makeNBOCtest.c program was supposed
   to call your function, but doesn't.  You didn't follow the directions.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm: The commands you gave work for building
   this program.

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  92.50% of  5 points =  4.63 points
   homework03 ~  84.44% of  5 points =  4.22 points
   homework04 ~  60.00% of  5 points =  3.00 points
   homework05 ~  93.00% of 10 points =  9.30 points
   homework06 ~  57.00% of 15 points = 10.00 points
                       semester total: 45.00 out of 45.00 = 100.00%
                                total: 26.15 out of 30.00 = 87.17%
                             which is an A-plus

You get 10 points for homework06 because you submitted code [5 points] and you
followed the directions to include the build commands [5 points].  However, the
commands you submitted didn't work.

Not bad for this assignment.  Great having you in class this semester and I look
forward to seeing you in the Spring!
